Question: For a 4-ary tree, what is the maximum possible height with 100 nodes? Assume height of single node is 0

Answer: In 4-ary tree each node can contain 0 to 4 children and to get maximum height, we need to keep only one child
  for each parent. With 100 nodes the maximum possible height we can get is 99.

  If we have a restriction that at least one node has 4 children, then we keep one node with 4 children and remaining
  nodes with 1 child. In this case, the maximum possible height is 96%. Similarly, with n nodes the maximum possible height
  is n-4
